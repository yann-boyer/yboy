This is yboy, a really W.I.P GameBoy emulator written in Rust.



I'm writing this emulator to improve my Rust programming skills, it's a language I want to master in the long run.





Project started : December 16th 2023 at 11:41 AM UTC+1.




The project has started very recently, and I'm kinda slow to learn new things, don't expect a working and bug-free emulator anytime soon, I'll need time to fully understand how the GameBoy works.
